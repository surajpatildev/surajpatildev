# Hey there! 👋 I'm Suraj

Welcome to my corner of the internet where ideas become software and problems get solved! ✨

## 🚀 What I'm all about

I'm a software engineer who gets genuinely excited about building things that work. Whether it's crafting an LLM-powered app, architecting a robust backend, or designing an entire system from scratch - I love the entire journey from "what if we could..." to "here's how it works!" 

**Currently building:**
- 🤖 LLM applications that feel magical but work reliably
- 🏗️ Backend systems that scale without breaking a sweat  
- 🔧 End-to-end solutions that solve real problems
- ⚡ Architectures that make complex things look simple

## 🛠️ My playground

```python
toolkit = {
    "languages": ["Python", "JavaScript"],
    "backend_magic": ["Django", "FastAPI", "Flask"],
    "frontend_fun": ["React"],
    "data_friends": ["PostgreSQL", "Snowflake", "Redis"],
    "cloud_adventures": ["AWS", "Docker", "Kafka"],
    "ai_experiments": ["LLMs", "GenAI", "Multi-agent Systems"],
    "solution_design": ["System Architecture", "API Design", "Microservices"]
}
```

## 🌱 When I'm not coding

- 📝 Writing about engineering challenges on the [Velotio blog](https://www.velotio.com/engineering-blog/)
- 🎯 Designing solutions that developers actually want to work with
- 🤝 Mentoring fellow builders (because great ideas are better when shared!)
- ☕ Experimenting with new tech over way too much coffee

## 🎯 Fun facts

- 🏆 Once got "Superstar of the Quarter" for building systems that just work
- 🔧 Started with mechanical engineering, fell in love with software engineering (best career plot twist ever!)
- 📈 Built everything from Salesforce apps to conversational AI to high-throughput platforms
- 🚀 Believe the best solutions are the ones that feel obvious in hindsight
